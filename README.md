# Salary Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting salaries based on years of experience using machine learning models. By utilizing a dataset with experience and salary data, regression techniques are applied to build an accurate predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two columns:

- **`experience_years`**: The number of years of experience an individual has.
- **`salary`**: The salary corresponding to the individual's experience level.

## Methodology

The project workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Loading the salary dataset using Pandas.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distribution, exploring correlations, and identifying potential outliers.
3. **Data Preparation**: Handling missing values and removing duplicates to ensure clean data.
4. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
5. **Model Training**: Training three regression models:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Decision Tree Regression**
   - **Random Forest Regression**
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing each model's performance using metrics such as:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (RÂ²) score
7. **Model Selection**: Comparing model performances and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
8. **Model Saving**: Saving the best model for future use with `joblib`.

## Results

- **Model Performance**:

- **Best Model**: [State the name of the best-performing model and explain why it was chosen].

## Usage

To use the saved model for salary prediction:

1. Load the model using:
   ```python
   from joblib import load
   model = load('best_model.pkl')
